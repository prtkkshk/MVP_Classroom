# InfraLearn Platform - Audit Summary & Action Items

## ✅ Critical Issues (FIXED)

### 1. Security Vulnerability - HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS ✅ FIXED
**Location**: `src/store/authStore.ts` lines 95-105
**Issue**: Admin credentials are hard-coded in source code
**Risk**: High - Credentials exposed in version control
**Fix**: ✅ Moved to environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

### 2. Mock Implementations ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Many features use simulated API calls instead of real database operations
**Impact**: Features don't actually work in production
**Priority**: High

**Files fixed**:
- ✅ `src/app/dashboard/courses/create/page.tsx` - Course creation now uses real Supabase operations
- ✅ `src/components/notifications/NotificationCenter.tsx` - Notifications fetch from database
- ⚠️ `src/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Still needs real data implementation

---

## ⚠️ High Priority Issues

### 3. Missing Real-time Features
- Live sessions lack actual video/audio integration
- Real-time doubt updates not fully implemented
- Missing connection state management

### 4. Incomplete Error Handling ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Added ErrorBoundary component for React errors
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive loading states
- ✅ Added graceful error recovery
- ✅ Created reusable loading components

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation library (`src/lib/validation.ts`)
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting utility
- ✅ Added input sanitization for XSS prevention
- ⚠️ CSRF protection still needs implementation

---

## ✅ Working Features (Confirmed)

### Authentication & User Management
- ✅ Multi-role authentication (super_admin, professor, student)
- ✅ Institutional email validation for students
- ✅ JWT-based session management
- ✅ Username availability checking

### Course Management
- ✅ Course creation form with validations
- ✅ Auto-generated course codes
- ✅ Course listing and filtering
- ✅ Material CRUD operations

### File Management
- ✅ File upload with drag-and-drop
- ✅ File type validation (50MB limit)
- ✅ Material categorization

### UI/UX
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Modern ShadCN UI components
- ✅ Framer Motion animations
- ✅ Mobile-first approach
